# DevOps

## Core Practices
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Monitoring and observability
- Security and compliance

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated testing on code push
- Automated builds and deployments
- Rollback capabilities
- Staging environments

## Tools & Platforms
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD integrated with Git
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code
- **CloudFormation** - AWS IaC tool

## Containerization
- Docker images for consistency
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Container registries for storage
- Security scanning of images

## Monitoring & Observability
- Centralized logging with ELK or Datadog
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Alerting on anomalies
- Distributed tracing for debugging

## Cloud Platforms
- **AWS** - Comprehensive cloud services
- **Google Cloud Platform** - Data and ML focus
- **Azure** - Microsoft enterprise cloud
- **DigitalOcean** - Simple and affordable

## Best Practices
1. Automate everything repetitive
2. Implement proper access controls
3. Regular security audits
4. Document infrastructure decisions
5. Plan for disaster recovery

## Current Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Docker for application containerization
- Monitoring with structured logging
