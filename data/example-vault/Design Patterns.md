# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** - Single instance of a class
- **Factory** - Create objects without specifying exact classes
- **Builder** - Construct complex objects step by step
- **Prototype** - Clone objects rather than creating new

## Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** - Make incompatible interfaces work together
- **Decorator** - Add behavior to objects dynamically
- **Facade** - Provide simplified interface to complex system
- **Proxy** - Control access to another object

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer** - Notify multiple objects of state changes
- **Strategy** - Encapsulate interchangeable algorithms
- **State** - Alter behavior based on internal state
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Pass request along chain of handlers

## Architectural Patterns
- **MVC** - Model-View-Controller
- **Microservices** - Small independent services
- **Event-Driven** - Systems react to events
- **Layered Architecture** - Organize code into layers

## When to Use Patterns
- Solving common problems
- Improving code maintainability
- Facilitating team communication
- Supporting future extensions

## Anti-patterns to Avoid
- God object with too many responsibilities
- Spaghetti code with tangled logic
- Premature optimization
- Over-engineering simple solutions

## Related to Current Work
- Factory pattern for creating different RAG components
- Strategy pattern for different embedding models
- Decorator pattern for LLM response processing
