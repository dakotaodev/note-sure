# Learning Projects

## Current Projects
1. **Agentic RAG Solution** - Personal knowledge base chatbot
   - Integrate Obsidian vault with RAG
   - Build agent to make tool calls
   - Uses [[LLM Applications]], [[RAG Systems]], [[Vector Embeddings]]

2. **Vector Search Playground** - Experiment with embeddings
   - Compare different embedding models
   - Benchmark vector databases
   - Related: [[Vector Databases]], [[Vector Embeddings]]

3. **ML Monitoring System** - Track model performance
   - Real-time metrics collection
   - Anomaly detection
   - Related: [[DevOps]], [[Machine Learning]]

## Completed Projects
- ✅ Simple chatbot with LangChain
- ✅ Document summarization pipeline
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Planned Projects
- [ ] Fine-tune LLM on custom domain data
- [ ] Build recommendation system
- [ ] Deploy ML model to production
- [ ] Create LLM evaluation framework

## Learning Goals
- Master [[RAG Systems]] architecture
- Understand [[Transformer Architecture]] deeply
- Build production-ready ML systems
- Improve DevOps practices with [[DevOps]]

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **ML**: PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain
- **Databases**: Vector DBs, PostgreSQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Cloud**: AWS or DigitalOcean

## Reflection
Working on practical projects accelerates learning compared to just reading. Each project teaches new lessons about [[Design Patterns]], system design, and production considerations.
